# Data Structures and Algorithms Project

## Overview
This project was completed as part of a semester-long study on data structures and algorithms. The primary objectives of this project were to implement various data structures and algorithms, including Huffman encoding, and apply them to tasks related to image compression and file handling.

## Features
- **Image Upload and File Handling:** We developed functionalities to upload and open image files, allowing for seamless input and output operations with image data.

- **Huffman Encoding:** The project includes a comprehensive implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm. Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression technique that efficiently reduces the size of image files while preserving their quality.

- **Image Compression:** We applied Huffman encoding to achieve image compression. This process involves encoding and decoding image data to reduce file sizes without sacrificing image quality.

- **Documentation:** A detailed paper documents the entire project, providing insights into the algorithms used, implementation details, and the results obtained. This documentation serves as a valuable resource for understanding the project's inner workings.
